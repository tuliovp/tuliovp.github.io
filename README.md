                    This is an entry-level project to achieve an environment where I can expose my projects' portfolio, both in Web Development and Data Science, besides practicing the following skills:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>HTML</li>
                      <li>CSS</li>
                      <li>JavaScript</li>
                      <li>Design / UX</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <br>
                    <b>HTML</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I have followed the best practices I found in repositories on Github, in terms of code style and explanatory comments. Highlights from the HTML file include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Meta tag that gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling;</li>
                      <li>Meta tag used to summarize the web page's content - Search engines use it in search results to let visitors know what a page is about before they click on it;</li>
                      <li>Google Tag Manager, to identify visitor behavior within the site;</li>
                      <li>Visitors counter, from a third-party provider;</li>
                      <li>Spotify embedded playlist;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>CSS</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Despite its simplicity, there is a fair amount of code running behind it (~1500 lines of CSS), including:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>All dimensions to fit different screen sizes;</li>
                      <li>WebKit extensions to CSS & CSS [attribute] Selector;</li>
                      <li>Font APIs;</li>
                      <li>Toggles with adjustments;</li>
                      <li>Progress bar animations;</li>
                      <li>Two different types of modals/lightboxes;</li>
                      <li>Gallery of divs;</li>
                      <li>Hover overlay effects;</li>
                      <li>Filtering buttons;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>JavaScript</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I have chosen to work with pure JS, when jQuery was the mainstream go-to option. Pure Javascript to access the DOM can be faster as you can cut the overhead that jQuery has on this. You can find in the .js file functions working on the following actions:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Show email when clicked;</li>
                      <li>Scroll down slowly when clicked in Notes / Cases;</li>
                      <li>Modal to work with different files in the same webpage;</li>
                      <li>Next/previous controls;</li>
                      <li>Thumbnail image controls;</li>
                      <li>Show/hide filtered elements;</li>
                      <li>Highlight active class to the current control button;</li>
                      <li>Close modal when the user clicks anywhere outside it or clicks on <span> (x);</li>
                      <li>Song player</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>Design / UX</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I thought of building a fairly simple site, approaching a level of minimalism that I fancy on other webpages out there. The main challenge was to bootstrap it all from scratch, without using any template as a base (although having several inspirations, obviously).</p>
                    <p>A few design goals of mine:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Monochromatic, give the impression of a paper CV;</li>
                      <li>Personal touch (Notes / Cool stuff / Jam / Cinema) - not just the cheesy professional stuff;</li>
                      <li>Divs instead of "a" to increase the click area - and sometimes vice-versa;</li>
                      <li>Cursor style changes depending on what is clickable or not (it might get confusing sometimes);</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
